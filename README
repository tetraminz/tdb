Google cloud platform had recently shut down the Python 2.5 support, so AppInventor TinyWebDB code should be updated.
The only changes are:

app.yalm:
Change
  runtime: python
  to
  runtime: python27

Add threadsafe: false

Delete:
  application: customtinywebdb
  version: 1

main.py:
Replace
  from django.utils import simplejson as json
  with
  import json
